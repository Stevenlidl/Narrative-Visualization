            and 70 from 2001 to 2019.</h2>

                        <p>As medicare and technology grow, people should be less likely to Mortality from CVD, cancer, diabetes, or CRD compare to past days. It is known that as a country being developed well, the people have more money to put into their healthy and healthy habits. Therefore, it was natural to think that the Mortality rate from CVD, cancer, diabetes or CRD in higher-income group countries will be lower than in lower-income group countries. However, when I check the female data, it shows the hypothesis was not 100% correct. The low-income group has a lower rate than the lower middle-income group. Also, based on the total data (female + male), the low-income group has a similar rate compared to the lower middle-income group. 
                            Another observation from the data is the female Mortality rate is clearly lower than males.
                            </p><p>Based on the above points, I want to share that information as a narrative story that allows users to interact which the data. </p>
